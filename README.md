## Why This?

Providing necessary context and checking the facts when politicians and other public figures speak is a critical part of our journalism at POLITICO. Doing them live comes with some hard technical challenges, especially when that context requires many fact-checkers and when we want to show our work alongside the original source.

This library aims to make that process easier by leveraging a platform that is already very good at solving the hard problems involved: Google docs. Using GSpan youâ€™ll have an end-to-end system for acquiring transcripts of a live event, creating a collaborative editing environment in Google docs for fact-checkers to annotate that transcript and, finally, structuring all that data in a way it can be easily consumed by a front-end application or site.

## How It Works

GSpan comes with two main features that are designed to work together: [transcription](docs/TranscribingToADoc.md) and [downloading/parsing](docs/DownloadingADoc.md).

It uses [Opened Captions](https://openedcaptions.com/) created by [Dan Schultz](https://twitter.com/slifty) as the source of the transcription. You can [read more about the Opened Captions project on Source](https://source.opennews.org/articles/introducing-opened-captions/). These captions are written into a Google Doc using [a special markup](docs/AnnotatingDocs.md/#creating-speaker-changes-or-soundbites) to signify things like speaker changes and soundbites. Then, reporters can [use the native commenting functionality to annotate documents](docs/AnnotatingDocs.md).

Once annotations are done you can convert that Google Doc (with all its annotations) into [structured data](docs/DataSignature.md) using GSpan's download functionality. All the unique markup will be turned into an easy-to-use JSON format with rich text elements rendered as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

What you do with that data and how your page looks is up to you, but [here's what we did](#demo).


## Quick Start

Install the package globally to use the CLI

```
$ npm install -g gspan
```

Create a [Google Doc](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). Share it with your Google service account's client email (see [Authenticating](#authenticating)). Get the Doc ID for that document. You can find it in the URL between `d/` and `/edit` like this:

![docId](docs/images/docId.jpg)

With an ID in hand you can begin transcribing and downloading with the CLI.

##### Transcribing from C-Span into a Google Doc

```
gspan transcribe <doc>

Begins transcribing CSPAN into a document.

Positionals:
  doc  The Google Doc ID                                     [string] [required]

Options:
  --verbose, -v     Log new entries in the console                     [boolean]
  --backfill, -b    Start from a saved backup file                     [boolean]
  --backupFile, -f  A filepath to save a backup                         [string]
```

##### Downloading and parsing data from a Google Doc

```
gspan download <doc> [output]

Downloads a GSpan doc as a JSON file.

Positionals:
  doc     The Google Doc ID                                  [string] [required]
  output  The directory to save the file to                             [string]

Options:
  --authorAPI, -a           A link to an authors API                    [string]
  --authorNameAccessor, -n  Accessor for Google display name            [string]
  --authorIdAccessor, -i    Accessor for unique ID                      [string]
  --defaultPublish, -p      Default for annoation published state      [boolean]
```

<em>* Boolean arguments can be set to false by setting them equal to false or by adding the `no-` prefix to their name. (e.g. `gspan transcribe DOC_ID --no-verbose` or `gspan download DOC_ID -p=false`)</em>


## Authenticating

In order to use this app you'll need a Google Service Account which has write access to your Google Doc. For help with creating a Google Service Account, see [Making A Google Service Account](docs/GoogleServiceAccount.md).

Once you have your credentials file, you'll need the `client_email` and `private_key`. You'll need to make sure that these are saved as environment variables in your runtime under the keys of `GAPI_CLIENT_EMAIL` and `GAPI_PRIVATE_KEY` respectively.

There's a number of ways to do this depending on your workflow. If you've never worked with environment variables in node check out [this guide](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html).

Finally, also make sure to share the Google Doc you're using with the `client_email`. It may look long and not like a valid email, but Google will allow it.

## Demo
Our inaugural use of GSpan was for the 2019 State of the Union. Check out the [page](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-state-of-the-union-2019-live-fact-check-transcript-2/5/19/) and [data](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-state-of-the-union-2019-live-fact-check-transcript-2/5/19/data/data.json) data that powered it.
